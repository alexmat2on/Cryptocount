# Cryptocount

A JavaScript app that keeps track of your cryptocurrency assets.

Please note that this is still a work in progress, so bugs and rough edges are to
be expected! That said, feel free to test a live version [here](https://alexmat2on.github.io/Cryptocount/).

## Planned Ideas & Features
* Limit numbers to 2 or 4 decimal places max.
* Add asset icons to the UI
* Make it possible to delete a tab
* Make Settings button actually open a Settings page. The Settings page will
allow you to import/export app data, clear app data, and perhaps change themes
(if I write alternative themes).
* Add a search function to the dropdown menu
* Add many, many more cryptocurrency options
* Make the tab pages more detailed; I plan on making it possible for users to
input individual Buy/Sell transactions and list them all in a table on each asset's page.
* Add data visualizations with ChartJS on the Overview page.
